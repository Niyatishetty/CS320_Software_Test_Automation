1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure my code or software is functional by writing the unit tests, system test and integration testing. Use the code coverage tools and verify that the coverage is more than 85%. I can ensure the code is secure by doing the Static testing, like code review, and use some tools to check the vulnerabilities in the code. Use best coding practices. This will ensure code is secure, functional and performs to the industry standard.
  
2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Gather the users needs, create the requirements documents, and then break down the requirement document to smaller components and implement the code. Write the unit test to enforce the requirements like the field lenght in the ContactID, and fields cannot be null, or in ContactService, we cannot store duplicate contact object with same ID etc.
   
3. How do I approach designing software?
My software approach to designing the software is Agile method. I understand the requirements, implement the code in small increments, write the unit test and ensure all the requirements are covered, then move to next requirement. Using this method, we have less bugs, and the modules are implemented in smaller chunks.
